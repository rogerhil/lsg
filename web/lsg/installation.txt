PS: old instructions below to setup without using docker!

# Setup
 - Install Python 3.5
 - Install postgres
 - Install postgis (windows: Postgres Application Stack Builder)
 - Windows: Put postgres bin folder in the PATH env variable
 - Create database lsg
 - Create a virtualenv based on Python 3.5: "virtualenv -p python3.5 lsgenv"
 - Activate your virtualenv by doing: "source lsgenv/bin/activate"
 - Windows: Install win-psycopg http://stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/
 - Windows: Install OSGeo4W: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/contrib/gis/install/#windows
 - Run: pip install -r requirements.txt (install pip in case is not installed)
 - create a "localsettings.py" file under the "server/config/" directory
 - customize your local database settings based on the "DATABASES" variable located in the main "settings.py". (copy & paste and change it.)
 - *apply the patches in the "patches" folder in case the step below fails.
 - manage.py migrate

Some commands to populate DB:
 - To populate games from TheGamesDb: under the server directory run: PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/populate_games_db.py
 - To populate World DB: under the server directory run: python manage.py shell, >>> from world.load import run; run()
