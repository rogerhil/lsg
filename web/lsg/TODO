 * Profile:
    - Validation client (verify all server first)
    - Permission to get/post/put/delete
    - Profile photo (look angle tmplate profile page as an example)
    - Improve form, re-use using templates to avoid repetition of code,
      especially because of error messages from validation, or something to
      integrate with django forms.

 * Games:
    - !!! SHOW A MESSAGE in the game search field in case the user didn't
      specify his platforms in the profile page.
    - Permission to get/post/put/delete
    - Only allow to add game to collection/wishlist if the game belongs to the
      list of platforms defined on the profile page. (disable the ?platform_id=
      filter in JS to check this and fix in the server)
    - In case a platform is removed from the list of platforms in the profile
      page, also deletes all the games of that platform from the
      collection/wishlist.

 * Matches:
    - Request: (radio buttons required validation in client not working)
    - Request: add google maps :)
    - check logic of ignore requests already made (tup)

 * Request:
    - Think about: "change feedback field name to reputation"

 * General REST:
    - Check all services/permission/options disallowing not needed services.
    - Maybe remove not needed fields from the responses.
    - Use django tool bar to improve performance.
